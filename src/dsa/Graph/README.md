- Type: `Graph`

## Undirected graph
### Using vertices - edge matrix
- Properties:
    - [x] Undirected
    - [x] Simple/multigraph
    - [x] No self-loop

> [See implementation](./lib/undirected_graph/vertices_edges_graph.c)

## Directed graph
### Using vertices - vertices matrix
- Properties:
    - [x] Directed
    - [x] Simple/Multigraph
    - [x] Self-loop

> [See implementation](./lib/directed_graph/vertices_vertices_graph.c)

<!-- ## Using list of adjacents
